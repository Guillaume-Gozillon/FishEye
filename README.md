<h2>Prototype features:</h2>

<h3>Home page:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>List of all photographers with their name, slogan, location, price / hour, tags and a thumbnail image of their choice.</li>
    <li>By clicking on a tag in the navigation bar, the list of photographers is filtered to display only those who match this tag.</li>
    <li>When the user clicks on a photographer's thumbnail, they are taken to their page.</li>
</ul<>>

<h3>Photographers pages (one for each sample photographer):</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Displays a gallery of the photographer's work.</li>
    <li>Photographers can show both photos and videos.</li>
</ul<>>

<p>In case of videos content, show a thumbnail image in the gallery.</p>

<h3>Each media includes title, date, price and number of shots:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>When the user clicks on the "Like" icon, it increases the number of likes displayed.</li>
    <li>The total number of shots should be counted and added to the photographer's profile total.</li>
</ul<>>

<h3>Media can be sorted by popularity, date or title.</h3>

<p>When the user clicks on a medium, it should open in a lightbox:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When the lightbox is displayed, there is a cross in the corner to close the window.</li>
    <li>Navigation buttons allow switching between media items (users can click these buttons to navigate).</li>
    <li>The arrow keys also navigate between media.</li>
</ul<>>

<h3>Show a button to contact the photographer:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The contact form is a modal that is displayed on top of the rest.
    â—‹ It includes fields for names, email address and message.</li>
    <li>It includes fields for names, email address and message.</li>
    <li>Later the contact button will send a message to the photographer. For now, only display the content of the three fields in the console logs.</li>
</ul<>>

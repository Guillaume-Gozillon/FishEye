<h2>Prototype features:</h2>

<h3>Home page:</h3>
● Home page:

    ○ List of all photographers with their name, slogan, location, price / hour, tags and a thumbnail image of their choice.
    ○ By clicking on a tag in the navigation bar, the list of photographers is filtered to display only those who match this tag.
    ○ When the user clicks on a photographer's thumbnail, they are taken to their page.


● Photographers pages (one for each sample photographer):

    ○ Displays a gallery of the photographer's work.
    ○ Photographers can show both photos and videos.


■ In the case of videos, show a thumbnail image in the gallery.

○ Each media includes title, date, price and number of shots:

    ○ When the user clicks on the "Like" icon, it increases the number of likes displayed.
    ○ The total number of shots should be counted and added to the photographer's profile total.

○ Media can be sorted by popularity, date or title.

○ When the user clicks on a medium, it should open in a lightbox:

    ○ When the lightbox is displayed, there is a cross in the corner to close the window.
    ○ Navigation buttons allow switching between media items (users can click these buttons to navigate).
    ○ The arrow keys also navigate between media.

○ Show a button to contact the photographer:

    ○ The contact form is a modal that is displayed on top of the rest.
    ○ It includes fields for names, email address and message.
    ○ Later the contact button will send a message to the photographer. For now, only display the content of the three fields in the console logs.
